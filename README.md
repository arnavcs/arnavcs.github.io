# arnavcs.github.io

This is my [personal website](https://arnavcs.github.io), a site that has gone through multiple revisions in order to ensure that it is lightweight and visually appealing.

I have settled on writing site content with Pandoc markdown and compiling to HTML with a custom stylesheet.

There are two main page types based on the type of content they are meant to convey:
- Episodic sites to display information where the order of the content is irrelevant
- Serial sites that have an order to the content presented
