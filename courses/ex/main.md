This is some example stuff for if I decide to take notes this way next term.

# Lecture 14

Propositional logic is weak. It doesn't give us any insight into the inner workings of our statements.
We need a more expressive logic that can encapsulate the parts of a statement.

## Intro to First Order Logic (FOL)

We can break statements into two components: objects and properties.

FOL is actually a large family of languages rather than a single language like propositional logic was.
Some things that are common between all of these families, though, are

- propositional connectives ($\neg$, $\land$, $\lor$, $\rightarrow$)
- quantifiers ($\forall$, $\exists$)
- equality ($=$)

Additionally, there are 3 types of language specific symbols:

- constant symbols
- relations symbols
- function symbols
