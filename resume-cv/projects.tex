\projectHead{\href{https://github.com/youssefsoli/IPFE}{InterPlanetary File Explorer (IPFE)}}{Go, Python, Scikit-learn, Estuary, Co:here, Three.js}{Jan 2023}
\begin{resumeList}
    \item Created vector embeddings for files with their headers using Co:here's NLP embeddings to facilitate classification of files.
    \item Performed principal component analysis of the vector embeddings to reduce the dimensionality from 4096 to 3 to be plotted and displayed interactively in 3D space using Three.js.

\projectHead{\href{https://github.com/arnavcs/OSIC-IPF}{Prognosing Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)}}{Python, Tensorflow2, Pandas, Scikit-learn}{Dec 2020 - Jun 2021}
\begin{resumeList}
    \item Implemented an auto-encoder, linear regression, dense neural network, and bayesian model in order to accurately predict future lung capacity and give a confidence value using initial lung capacity data, age, sex, smoking status, and more.
    \item Obtained a Laplace Log Likelihood score of $-6.9$ (much better than the baseline score $-8.1$) with $\sigma \approx 200$mL.

\projectHead{\href{https://github.com/arnavcs/cli-chess}{CLI Chess}}{Haskell}{Aug 2022 - Present}
\begin{resumeList}
    \item Created a local mulitplayer chess clone in Haskell that can be played in the CLI with the Haskell REPL.
    \item Developed safe and scalable functions to determine the state of the board and indentify check and checkmate.
    \item Employed lists as applicative functors and monads to write concise, readable code for determining all valid next moves.

% \begin{resumeList}
%     \item Used thresholding in OpenCV to determine which pixels of the output art should be shaded.
%     \item Transformed the image array into braille characters using 3x2 pixel filters which returned a binary number corresponding to a braille character.
