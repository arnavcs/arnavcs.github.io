    Surf's Up is a film that I rewatched yesterday after a while.
    The film originally came out in 2001, which is quite a long time ago, but it might just be the film that I've rewatched the most number of times.

    You see, growing up, I loved playing the Surf's Up game on the Gamecube with my brother, and everytime I went back to revisit the console games that I owned, I remembered the charm of the movie and the game.
    I think that the movie has had a pretty big effect on me, but I don't think I properly understood the message that was being conveyed.

    The reason I decided to rewatch Surf's Up was becasue Sony released KPop Demon Hunters, and they seem to be taking steps into more adventurous animation teritory in a way that seems to be working really well for them.
    The hype around the movie along with my computer graphics related YouTube recommendation page is probably the reason I got some videos about Sony in my YouTube homepage, like <a href="https://youtu.be/ucZ2qb9Tk_g">(this)</a> one.
    And after that, I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/08aCOf088I8">(this)</a> video about how Surf's Up is about existentialism.
    It was definitely an interesting take, albeit not one that I necessarily agree with.

   <p>
    In any case, these two videos seemed to get me to rewatch Surf's Up and to watch KPop Demon Hunters for the first time, which I am glad I did!
