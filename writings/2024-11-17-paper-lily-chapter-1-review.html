    I had never played a horror RPG game before this, but deciding to play Paper Lily Chaper 1 was well worth it.
    I wonder if its right to call it a horror RPG though, since it seems to involve a lot of elements from different genres.
    You can find it on <a href="https://leef6010.itch.io/paper-lily-chapter-1">(Itch.io)</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2220360/Paper_Lily__Chapter_1/">(Steam)</a>.
    In this post, I want to talk about some of my favourite parts of the game and what I think it does right.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Pacing</b>: The pacing is well done and for a chapter in a series, I didn't feel like it was too short or long.</li>
    <li><b>Difficulty</b>: The game difficulty is well done.
        Although I found myself dying often, I believe that this is intended with so many intentional bad endings.
        The idea of having multiple ways to solve the puzzles means that you probably won't get stuck on a puzzle.
        The explanation of controls and rules is also good and never too vague.</li>
    <li><b>Soundtrack</b>: The soundtrack is very well made and always accompanies what is happening in the game.
        I daresay the music is on par with Undertale's soundtrack.</li>
    <li><b>Art</b>: The art is stunningly done.
        There is no doubt that the colourscheme they chose is good, but I love when the game uses black and white imagery in the explanatory cutscenes.
        I also adore the combined use of pixel art and higher resolution digital art.
        The art style is really cute for a horror game but it adds a sort of warmth that made me interested in the game in the first place.</li>
    <li><b>Gameplay Mechanics</b>: The gameplay is good, and the main mechanic of puzzle solving is well done.
        The objectives system is helpful, but sometimes I would forget that in order to use an item, I had to select it from the inventory.
        Maybe if I had played the prequel first, it would have been more clear to me.
        I loved the sections where there was an evident shift in gameplay mechanic, like the sections which shifted to a top-down sokoban puzzle.
        More notably, the encounter with Miss Knives which used a top-down 2d grid based movement and required dodging attacks reminded me of Helltaker's final battles or of Undertale's unique battling system.</li>
    <li><b>Plot</b>: The plot was very engaging and made me interested in seeing the game to the end.
        The game introduces a lot of questions, and as a player, I felt like there was sufficient motivation to keep playing from the suspense it creates.</li>
    <li><b>Characters</b>: This game doesn't have too many characters, but all of them have a charm to them.
        I love the character designs with respect to art and personality. </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who is even mildly interested!
    I look forward to the release of chapter 2 and have shown my support by purchasing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694250/Paper_Lily__Chapter_1_Supporter_Pack/">(Supporter Pack)</a>.
