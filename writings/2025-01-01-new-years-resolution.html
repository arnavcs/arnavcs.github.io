    As we go into the new year of 2025, I would like to document my new years resolution.
    I have decided to complete at least one book every month of the year of 2025.

    In the year of 2024, I did not dedicate nearly as much time as I had wanted into reading, but at the end of the year, I finished <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> by Robin Wall Kimmerer which had a great impact on me, and really got me excited about reading more again.
    To keep track, I will be adding a section to my webpage for rating the books that I read.
