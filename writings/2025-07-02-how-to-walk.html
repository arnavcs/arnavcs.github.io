    There have been a lot of instances where something you think of as almost trivial is something that has quite a bit of nuance to it.
    Walking is something that you have learnt in your childhood, and while you may think nothing of it right now, it's an extremely complex task that requires the coordination of a number of systems.
    Why else has it taken so long to get robots able to walk?
   </p>
   <p>
    One interesting aspect of walking is that even though it seems so trivial, if you take the time to observe how people walk, the way they hold themselves while they walk, you'll find a lot of variation.
    Sadhguru once mentioned that you can judge the physical fitness of someone simply by how they walk.
    After hearing that, I couldn't help but watch how different people walk.
    If you watch them, you can notice that almost everyone's body moves a little differently based on muscle stiffnesses, pains, or maybe habits.

    So is there a "right" way to walk?
    Well, I am not sure if I can ever classify something as right or wrong, but I think there is something to be said about walking consciously.
    Even myself, I have found that whenever I focus on the way I walk and all of the sensations on my foot on the ground or against my shoe, it feels magical.
    It definitely feels like I am the one doing the walking, and not that I am simply moving.
    Sometimes slowing down to experience something that we take for granted everyday is illuminating.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another interesting idea that I seem to remember is the importance of walking barefoot to stimulate the nerve endings in your feet.
    Walking on grass, dirt, or stones barefoot requires some amount of focus when you're walking, but it also has a pleasant feeling that you have to have tried for yourself to understand.
    Have we, as a society, made a grave mistake by wearing shoes which limit the ability of our feet to feel the ground and box in our toes?
    Perhaps that's a bit too harsh, since shoes definitely do keep our feet clean, and prevent thorns, and sharp objects from piercing us.
    Although there may be some truth to the downsides of wearing tight shoes.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is this movement of wearing barefoot shoes or wide toe box shoes in order to prevent the toes from being crammed together while wearing shoes.
    This seems quite reasonable to me, and I think that it likely isn't too good an idea to cram any part of your body into a certain shape.
    I haven't yet started doing so myself, though, and I'm not sure I will in the near future.
   </p>
   <p>
    Aside from the toe spread or not, I've heard that wearing shoes has changed the way that we walk.
    Wearing shoes promotes walking heel first, but our human legs were not desiged with this in mind.
    I've even heard how walking with shoes restricts the foot muscles from developing which form a strong arch and that people tend to have less stable stances, due to an underutilized big toe and little toe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ultimately, I think that it important to have a sense of consciousness about the way you are walking while you wear shoes (and while you don't) and to maintain a flexible body so that you may walk more effortlessly.
    I've been tyring to take more care of the way I walk myself, and I think that the repercussions of how you walk has much more to do with your wellbeing than simply foot cramps.
    After all, entire systems of wellbeing like acupressure are based upon putting pressure and massaging different parts of the feet to affect the organs of the whole body.
