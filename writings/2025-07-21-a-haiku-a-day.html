    Because I've recently taken to writing things down in a notebook and actually logging my actions down, I figured I can start trying to choose one important or outstanding moment of my day and reflect on it at the end of the day.
    I've heard a lot of people try this with various methods, some of which are
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Taking a "photo of the day" which highlights the most memorable event of the day</li>
    <li>Writing in a journal about what you are grateful for in the day</li>
    <li>Simply recalling all of the events of the day, and evaluating what you did</li>
    <li>Just write about anything that comes to your mind for 30 minutes a day</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    I have taken my shot at methods 3 and 4, which I must say, are both really helpful.
    I think that writing stuff down is really transformative, despite my initial skepticism.
    I've felt no need for writing things down when I was younger, but perhaps I have lost my mental edge and my discipline, but writing things down is very useful for me now.
   </p>
   <p>
    But both 3 and 4 seem to be things that can take quite a lot of time out of the day.
    That's why I like the idea of doing a haiku a day.
    It's such a short poem, so you really need to think about what was notable about the day, and it emulates the idea of a "photo of the day" with more liberty and no need to carry around a camera.

    Here are the haikus from my first week!
