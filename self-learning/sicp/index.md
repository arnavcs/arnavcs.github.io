# Introduction

The Wizard Reading Club spawned from a curiosity of what the wizard book, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman, has to offer.

The text is avaliable completely for free in [(pdf)](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) and [(html)](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html) file formats.

In addition, video lectures and accompanying course content are avaliable [(here)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/), but this is not the main focus of this reading club.

# Meeting 1

## Exercise 1.1

```
10
12
8
3
6
19
#f
4
16
6
16
```

## Exercise 1.2

```scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))))
   (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

## Exercise 1.3

```scheme
(define (min a b) (if (a < b) a b))

(define (sum-sq a b) (+ (a * a) (b * b)))

(define (f a b c)
  (define m (min (min a b) c))
  (cond ((= a m) (sum-sq b c))
        ((= b m) (sum-sq a c))
        (else    (sum-sq a b))))
```

## Exercise 1.4

The operation is selected based on if `(> b 0)`. In specific, if `b` is greater than `0`, then the result is `(+ a b)` and otherwise it is `(- a b)`.

## Exercise 1.5

With an interpreter using applicative order, the program will hand and never terminate.
It will attempt to evaluate `(p)` first (as it is an argument of `test`), which is not computable.

With normal order, though, the program would terminate, yielding the value `0`.
In specific, `(p)` will never be attempted to be evaluated because of the normal-order.

## Exercise 1.6

`if` is a special form, whereas `new-if` is simply a proceedure, so that all arguments are evaluated first.

This means that `sqrt-iter` will never terminate because it will recursively call itself forever.

## Exercise 1.7

When small, the ratio of estimate to actual value is high.
When large, floating point numbers are more coarse and there aren't numbers within 0.001 of the desired value.

```scheme
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (new-guess g x)
    (/ (+ g (/ x g)) 2))
  (define (sqrt-iter g x)
    (define g* (new-guess g x))
    (if (< (abs (/ (- g* g) g*)) 0.001)
        g*
        (sqrt-iter g* x)))
  (sqrt-iter 1 x))
```

## Exercise 1.8

```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (* guess guess guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (* y y))
        (* 2 y))
     3))

(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```
