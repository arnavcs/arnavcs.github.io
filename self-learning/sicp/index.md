# Introduction

The Wizard Reading Club spawned from a curiosity of what the wizard book, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman has to offer.

The text is avaliable completely for free in [(pdf)](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) and [(html)](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html) file formats.

In addition, video lectures and accompanying course content are avaliable [(here)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/), but this is not the main focus of this reading club.
